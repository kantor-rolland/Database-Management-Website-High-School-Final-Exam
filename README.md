# Data Management Website

This is a project for High School final exam.

The topic of my thesis is the inventory management of a pig farm.

The languages I used are: 
- HTML: Structure of te web pages, interface elements, textual content, menu bar and the content of various pages
- CSS: Style
- PHP: Operations are performed using PHP, connecting the interface and physical parts of the website. Here, data input is recorded, compliance with conditions is checked, and instructions are executed, including executing queries
- SQL/MySQL: For operations with the database, such as data uploading and querying
- JAVASCRIPT: I utilized JavaScript to make the website dynamic. This programming language runs continuously in the background whenever the page is open.

The project documentation is in Hungarian!!!

The project can be run with PHPMyAdmin.
All_files.zip includes the the code files (html, php, js), images and some unused files... but does not include the real databases.
